# MoneyManager2022

MoneyManager2022 is a windows application that helps people keep track of their budget. The application allows the user to add an expense at a set day and time with an amount and a desciption. Entries can be modifed or removed after their addition. The application maintains state by saving and loading data from and to a file, that way the data is saved to the local storage and can be retrieved with the software. The application can generate a pie chart to show the user the proportions of their spending. Viewing and organising data is made single through date and category filters which allow the user to pinpoint their abnormal spendings.

The project is a WPF budget management application, backed by either a local SQLite database, or a remote database requiring authentication and a connection to the John Abbott College VPN.
